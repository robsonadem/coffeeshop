# coffeeshop
A popular coffee shop chain is opening a new coffee shop on College Hill. The project is to analyze data and determine the optimal number of cashiers that maximizes profit. There are a number of conditions that are taken into consideration. The shop opens at 6 am and closes at 10 pm. Besides, when a customer arrives at the shop, the customer waits for available cashier in a single queue. However, this queue has a limit of (8 times the number of cashiers). If a customer arrives whilst the queue has reached its limit, the customer will be turned back. This project effectively output the following key components: the arrival and departure times of all customers, the amount of daily net profit, the rate of “overflow”, the average and maximum waiting time of all customers served. Moreover, in this very report, the daily net profit as a function of number of cashiers and optimal number of cashiers as a function of lambda, a poission distribution measure used to calculate arrival intervals.
